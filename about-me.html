            <h2>Bio: The Journey So Far</h2>
            <p>I'm a dedicated learner with a deep interest in building robust, user-centric web interfaces. My
                background has equipped me with strong problem-solving skills, which I enjoy translating into efficient
                and elegant code structures. I strive to be a developer who bridges design and functionality seamlessly.

            <h2>Goals in This Program</h2>
            <p>My primary objectives are focused on foundational mastery and professional readiness:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Achieve complete fluency in **vanilla JavaScript** to handle complex application logic.</li>
                <li>Build multiple real-world projects that demonstrate mobile-first, **responsive design**.</li>
                <li>Internalize **WCAG accessibility standards** (ARIA, keyboard navigation) as a non-negotiable part of
                    development.</li>
                <li>Develop expertise in efficient DOM manipulation and performance optimization.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- 3. Areas of low confidence -->
        <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
            <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
            <p>Currently, my area of lowest confidence is handling **advanced browser API interactions** and memory
                management in long-running single-page applications. While I understand basic concepts, ensuring my code
                remains performant and avoids memory leaks in highly dynamic scenarios is a challenge I aim to overcome
                through dedicated practice.</p>

            <h3>A Note to Future Self</h3>
            <p>Keep the beginner's mind! Don't let the complexity of large frameworks make you forget the beauty and
                power of HTML, CSS, and JS alone. Always document your tricky solutions, take regular breaks, and
                remember that debugging is just problem-solving with a keyboard. **And don't forget to validate your
                forms!**</p>

        <!-- 5. Extra thoughts -->
        <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
            <h2>Extra Thoughts on Web Development</h2>
            <p>I find the speed of change in frontend fascinating. It requires constant learning, but that volatility
                also makes it incredibly rewarding. The most satisfying moment is seeing a carefully structured piece of
                CSS and HTML render perfectly across multiple devicesâ€”it's a small victory for predictability in an
                unpredictable world.</p>
